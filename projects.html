			<p>Corex is a Discord bot programmed in Python. The purpose of Corex is to have server necessities, yet it also includes a variety of fun commands. Unfortunately Corex is not always online, as I do not have the money to pay for a server.</p>

			<p>corex-cmd is a terminal, as you may know, some command prompt commands are complicated to understand and fluently type out. Hence, I've created this with additional commands such as a speedtest, customizable settings, projects folder pre-made, and more. As of now, it is not released to the public; expecting to drop soon.</p>
